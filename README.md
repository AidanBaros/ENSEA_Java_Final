## Project description
Make a circle focused physics simulator.

## Primary Features
- Physics Sim
    - Environment 
        - Gravity
            - Body Gravity
                - No directional gravity all gravity is from objects
            - Directional Gravity 
                - Base is earth Gravity so going down at 9.8m/s^2
                - Able to change direction and force
        - Time (Simulation speed)
        - Delete if off screen
    - Object
        - Mass
        - Size
        - Elasticity
        - Initial velocity
        - Stating position
        - Color



## Main Ideas brainstormed so far:
